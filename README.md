# Stagem Skeleton Application

## Introduction

This is a skeleton application using the Zend Framework MVC or Middleware layer and module
systems. This application is meant to be used as a starting place for those
looking to get their feet wet with Zend Framework and StageM ecosystem.

## Installation using Composer

The easiest way to create a new Zend Framework project is to use
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).  If you don't have it already installed,
then please install as per the [documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).

To create your new Zend Framework project:

```bash
$ composer create-project -sdev stagem/zf-skeleton path/to/install
$ composer update
```

## Post installation process

1. Create database and create/edit `config/parameters.local.php` with next configuration
```php
return [
    'db' => [
        'database' => 'your_database_name',
        'username' => 'your_user_name',
        'password' => 'your_secret_password',
        'hostname' => '127.0.0.1',
        'port' => 3306,
        'charset' => 'utf8mb4',
        'collate' => 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci',
    ],
];
```

2. Create directory for assets (js, css, media)
```bash
$ mkdir -p public/assets
```

3. Prepare Migrations' diff and execute them
```php
$ mkdir -p data/DoctrineORMModule/Migrations
$ php public/index.php migrations:diff
$ php public/index.php migrations:migrate
```
 
4. Prepare project's Entities
```php
$ php public/index.php entity sync
```

5. Prepare admin user
```php
$ cp vendor/popov/zfc-user/data/Version20180404060817.php data/DoctrineORMModule/Migrations/
$ php public/index.php migrations:execute --up 20180404060817
```

After execution, console shows next output, it's normal
```bash
...
Migration 20180404060817 was executed but did not result in any SQL statements.
...
```

You can access to administrator area with `http://localhost/admin` 

**login**: **admin@stagem.com.ua**

**password**: **123456**

> Notice. Don't forget change default login and password for security reason. 


Once installed, you can test it out immediately using PHP's built-in web server:

```bash
$ cd path/to/install
$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t public/ public/index.php
# OR use the composer alias:
$ composer run --timeout 0 serve
```

This will start the cli-server on port 8080, and bind it to all network
interfaces. You can then visit the site at http://localhost:8080/
- which will bring up Zend Framework welcome page.

**Note:** The built-in CLI server is *for development only*.

## Development mode

The skeleton ships with [zf-development-mode](https://github.com/zfcampus/zf-development-mode)
by default, and provides three aliases for consuming the script it ships with:

```bash
$ composer development-enable  # enable development mode
$ composer development-disable # disable development mode
$ composer development-status  # whether or not development mode is enabled
```

You may provide development-only modules and bootstrap-level configuration in
`config/development.config.php.dist`, and development-only application
configuration in `config/autoload/development.local.php.dist`. Enabling
development mode will copy these files to versions removing the `.dist` suffix,
while disabling development mode will remove those copies.

Development mode is automatically enabled as part of the skeleton installation process. 
After making changes to one of the above-mentioned `.dist` configuration files you will
either need to disable then enable development mode for the changes to take effect,
or manually make matching updates to the `.dist`-less copies of those files.

## Running Unit Tests

To run the supplied skeleton unit tests, you need to do one of the following:

- During initial project creation, select to install the MVC testing support.
- After initial project creation, install [zend-test](https://zendframework.github.io/zend-test/):

  ```bash
  $ composer require --dev zendframework/zend-test
  ```

Once testing support is present, you can run the tests using:

```bash
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

If you need to make local modifications for the PHPUnit test setup, copy
`phpunit.xml.dist` to `phpunit.xml` and edit the new file; the latter has
precedence over the former when running tests, and is ignored by version
control. (If you want to make the modifications permanent, edit the
`phpunit.xml.dist` file.)

## Web server setup

### Apache setup

To setup apache, setup a virtual host to point to the public/ directory of the
project and you should be ready to go! It should look something like below:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName zfapp.localhost
    DocumentRoot /path/to/zfapp/public
    <Directory /path/to/zfapp/public>
        DirectoryIndex index.php
        AllowOverride All
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
        <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
        Require all granted
        </IfModule>
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>
```

### Nginx setup

To setup nginx, open your `/path/to/nginx/nginx.conf` and add an
[include directive](http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#include) below
into `http` block if it does not already exist:

```nginx
http {
    # ...
    include sites-enabled/*.conf;
}
```


Create a virtual host configuration file for your project under `/path/to/nginx/sites-enabled/zfapp.localhost.conf`
it should look something like below:

```nginx
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  zfapp.localhost;
    root         /path/to/zfapp/public;

    location / {
        index index.php;
        try_files $uri $uri/ @php;
    }

    location @php {
        # Pass the PHP requests to FastCGI server (php-fpm) on 127.0.0.1:9000
        fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME /path/to/zfapp/public/index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

Restart the nginx, now you should be ready to go!

## QA Tools

The skeleton does not come with any QA tooling by default, but does ship with
configuration for each of:

- [phpcs](https://github.com/squizlabs/php_codesniffer)
- [phpunit](https://phpunit.de)

Additionally, it comes with some basic tests for the shipped
`Application\Controller\IndexController`.

If you want to add these QA tools, execute the following:

```bash
$ composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit squizlabs/php_codesniffer zendframework/zend-test
```

We provide aliases for each of these tools in the Composer configuration:

```bash
# Run CS checks:
$ composer cs-check
# Fix CS errors:
$ composer cs-fix
# Run PHPUnit tests:
$ composer test
```
